This is a simple website designed to showcase a function made using Javascript.

The goal was to create a simple and userfriendly design to easily convert Fahrenheit
to Celsius and Celsius to Fahrenheit.

I wanted to try something different and used the alert box as an alternative to a
return tag.

I also display the values I use in the function to derive the answer in the body of the 
webpage.

Cheers!
